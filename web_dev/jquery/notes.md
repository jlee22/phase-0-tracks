Release 0: Make a plan
What sorts of resources will help?
- Resources on syntax, resources on how jquery interacts with javascript

How often should you stop and test what you just learned?
-As often as necessary to make sure I understand all the concepts.

Are breaks important?
-Taking a few microbreaks can reduce the risk of ergonomic injury.
-Breaks can help me refocus and overall improve learning efficiency.


I plan on...
-approaching the topic by looking up multiple resources on jquery.
-partaking in simple tutorials on jquery.
-writing some jquery, from basic to intermidiate, to test my understanding on the topic.

Notes: 
-jQuery is a JavaScript Library 
-jQuery greatly simplifies JavaScript programming

The jQuery library contains the following features:
-HTML/DOM manipulation
-CSS manipulation
-HTML event methods
-Effects and animations
-AJAX
-Utilities

-Learning wise, it is effective for me to try out various examples provided by jquery tutorials and seeing them in action.
