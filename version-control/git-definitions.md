* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
version control for software is the idea of keeping multiple versions of the software configurations well organized. It is useful because it allows multiple users to work on the software simletaneously, while keeping the software safe as it always has a backup it can roll back to.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is basically a clone of the master (original) software, and can be worked on and later merged back into the master.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
commit is basically finalizing a change made in the software, a good commit message will be specific on what is changed.
* What is a merge conflict?
merge conflict is what happens when the change cannot be merged into the master version due to coding errors.
