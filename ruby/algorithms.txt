Elevator algorithm:

- Record the elevator direction based on initial call
- Ask for the users to select a floor
	- If floor selected
		- Wait 3 seconds
	- Otherwise: close the elevator door
- Until reaching either the top or bottom
	- Move towards the initial call direction, stop at the first closest selected floor and stop:
		- Ask for users to select floor again
			- Wait 3 seconds
		- Otherwise: close the elevator door
